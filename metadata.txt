description=This plugin creates the .pdf file of CDU (Certificato di Destinazione Urbanistica).

about=This plugin creates the CDU (Certificato di Destinazione Urbanistica) using the vector layer of cadastre (parcels) and the vector layers of the urban plan. The selected parcel is intersected with the overlapping layers of the urban plan and the information from the related attribute tables are then printed in the final output. The output is a .pdf file containing all the information, related to the selected parcel, extracted through the intersection process. The .pdf file can be customized adding a logo, a title and a text paragraph (e.g. introduction, legislative references, etc.). All the other information printed in the final CDU file are instead retrieved by the plugin.
